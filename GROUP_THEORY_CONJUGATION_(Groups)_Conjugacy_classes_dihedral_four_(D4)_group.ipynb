        "Conjugacy classes are elements of the group that are \"similar\" like matrices are similar. A group can be partitioned by conjugacy classes, and to find these equivalence classes, each element of $g\\in G$ has to be conjugated by all other elements of the group $\\{aga^{-1},\\;a\\in G\\}.$\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that this is very different from cosets, in which a subgroup of $H\\leq G$ is multiplied separately by all elements of $G,$ either on the left $\\{g H ,\\;g\\in G\\}$ or on the right $\\{Hg,\\; g\\in G\\}.$\n",
        "\n",
        "However, If $G$ is a finite group, then for any group element $a\\in G,$ the elements in the conjugacy class of $a$ are in one-to-one correspondence with cosets of the centralizer of the element $a,$ denoted as $C_G(a).$  The centralizer of the element $a$ is the set of all the elements in the group that commute with $a.$ The centralizer is not just a subset; it is also a normal subgroup.\n",
        "\n",
        "To show this correspondence, pick two elements $b$ and $c,$ belonging to the same coset of $C_G(a).$ Because $b$ and $c$ are in the same coset, there will be some $z$ in the subgroup, which in this case is the centralizer $C_G(a),$ such that $b = cz.$ This is because both $b$ and $c$ arose from multiplying two elements of the subgroup $v$ and $w$ by the same element of the group $g,$ because this is the way cosets are built. Hence, $b=vg$ and $c=wg;$ and $b=cz \\implies vgg^{-1}=wgzg^{-1}.$ Since the centralizer is a normal sugroup, $gzg^{-1}\\in C_G(a),$ which means that $v=wy,$ where $y\\in C_G(a).$ Since neither $g,$ $z$ or $y$ where fixed initially, it is true that $b=cz.$\n",
