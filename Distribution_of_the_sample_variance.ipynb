This is one of those proofs that you might have to read through twice... perhaps reading it the first time just to see where we're going with it, and then, if necessary, reading it again to capture the details.

What happens is that when we estimate the unknown population mean $\\mu$ with $\\bar{X}$ we \"lose\" one degreee of freedom. This is generally true... a degree of freedom is lost for each parameter estimated in certain chi-square random variables."
